So here's the plan for the project:

1 - Get the data from the public defense website. ok
SCRAPPED 2 - Save the data into a csv file.
3 - Process the data.
3.1 - As a initial plan, it should check whether vital chokepoints of the city are flooded:
3.1.1 - Ximbica.
3.1.2 - Trevo do skatista.
3.1.3 - Fundos do Nardelli.
3.1.4 - Subida da rua Tuiuti.
4 - With the processed data, format a tweet.
5 - Tweet into a bot account.

1 - Get the data from the public defense website.
2 - Process the data so I can store it.
3 - Add the data to the database.

Here's the methods that will be used:

For obtaining the data:
Data scraping or API access, if I get it.

For analysing the data:
Python itself. For checking the passability of the chokepoints, all that is necessary is a comparison.
For further analysis, more would be needed.

For uploading the data to tweeter:
Check what is tweepy, and use it.
